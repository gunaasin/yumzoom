                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        Welcome to YumZoom! By accessing or using our platform as a <span class="mark">&nbsp;Customer, Restaurant Partner, or
                        Delivery Agent,&nbsp;</span> you agree to abide by these Terms and Conditions.<br><br>

                        Customers can browse and explore menus of various restaurants listed on YumZoom, select and
                        customize their food orders, and complete payments securely through the platform. Real-time
                        order tracking is available, ensuring transparency, while YumZoom facilitates delivery; however,
                        food quality remains the responsibility of the respective restaurant.<br><br>

                        Restaurants must register with accurate menu and service details. They are responsible for
                        managing and fulfilling orders received via YumZoom. While YumZoom helps restaurants expand
                        their reach,<span class="mark">&nbsp; it does not guarantee specific sales or revenue outcomes.</span><br><br>

                        <span class="mark">&nbsp;Delivery Agents are required to sign up and complete verification before receiving delivery
                        requests.</span> They must efficiently accept and deliver orders in a timely manner. Earnings are based
                        on completed deliveries, with fees subject to YumZoom’s policies.<br><br>

                        Users are responsible for maintaining account security. YumZoom strives to provide uninterrupted
                        services but does not guarantee constant availability. In case of disputes, YumZoom will attempt
                        to mediate issues but is not liable for third-party service concerns. Terms may be updated
                        periodically, and continued use of YumZoom constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.<br><br>

                        For support, inquiries, or complaints, users can contact YumZoom’s customer service through the
                        platform. By using YumZoom,  <span class="mark">&nbsp; you confirm that you have read, understood, and agreed to these
                        Terms and Conditions.</span>
